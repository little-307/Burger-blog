        "Here it is! FOX approached me about filming my family on Labor Day weekend as we run our small family owned burger restaurant (that is my dream, let me clarify. The restaurant is my dream. The Reality show not so much). I wanted nothing to do with having a film crew in the kitchen and all, but of course as any good producer would do. They got to talking to Linda (my wife), and her eyes literally lit up with the opportunity to be on TV and becoming some kind of reality star like Ozzy Osbourne. I don’t believe she really knows who Ozzy is. In a nutshell I guess, this is how we are here.",
        "I felt the need to give the family my horrible attempt at a pep talk, emphasizing the importance of the holiday weekend reminding them that this will make or break us. After all, we live where we work. I’m not going to lie, the burgers are awesome but the business is struggling. As I’m talking Eugine, dressed up in a burger to hand out samples keeps messing with his toy megaphone/noise maker just smashing the fart button. Tina is standing there scratching her itchy crotch while maintaining eye contact hoping I wouldn’t notice, but I need her to work the grill while Linda and I grind the meat down in the basement. What did I think was going to happen?",
        "While Linda and I were in the basement prepping the burgers I noticed her focus was off. She kept grilling me about what was so special about this weekend. Me with my focus on trying not to become homeless missed every not so subtle hint that it was our anniversary. This was her last straw. I mean, I have forgotten about my own birthday and the birth of one of the children ( I can’t remember which one it was, but I forgot ). I don’t know if it’s her way of giving me a second chance, but she flipped some switch and convinced herself that I was setting up some sort of surprise. I’m completely missing the opportunity to go with it, and struggling to convince her that I have nothing and she’s not hearing it.",
        "As luck has it on this block, the Health inspector happens to walk by with his trainee as Eugine is attempting to hand out sample burgers that were knocked off the tray by a grieving widow exiting the funeral home next door. Linda and I came back upstairs to find the city health inspector aggressively writing in his notebook surrounded by the kids, and Louise was explaining her version of the “Burger of the Day” titled “The Child Molester: comes with candy!”. To be honest it was clever, but the timing was the worst!. Linda all of a sudden comes around the corner as I’m getting a lashing from the inspector, and she knows the dude. Hugo! Come to find out Hugo and my wife dated before we got together. Not sure why she thought about telling me little details like how much of a better kisser he was, because it wasn’t helping. So Hugo and his tree of an assistant or whatever breaks it to me the reason for his surprise visit. A rumor has been going around that we serve human flesh in our burgers (thank you Louise).",
        "This Hugo then finds it necessary to apply this huge poster in my window alerting the public that our restaurant may be serving human flesh. Learning more about the rumor as to where exactly we get this flesh. You guessed it next door from the Crematorium. People start gathering outside, and not for the reason I was hoping for this morning. They are starting to get loud and making signs protesting my family’s business. I tried to go out and talk to the mob to straighten things out, but I quickly find out that I sent myself out on a suicide mission.",
        "Hugo was just sitting in his van that happens to have a mobile lab in the back to test our product and clear up the rumor, but he just happens to be taking the whole loss of Linda personally. He was the one that called the media, practically inviting the whole city to protest us. After my temper got the best of me, by reaching through the window of the van trying to choke the little worm with his own tie, he just left. I had no other choice but to try and reason with the mob. It started out a little rough, but I found an angle explaining how we treat the dead better than we do the living. I was on a role, they looked like they were starting to understand this was just a silly misunderstanding. That is when I was so rudely interrupted when a person yells out that I’m trying to defend cannibalism. What??!! NO!! That's where I lost them. Weird to say I’m grateful for the chud that threw the souvenir through our front window essentially causing the crowd to disperse. ",
        "Now, I am at my lowest. There is no fixing this. I’m a failure who has assholes for kids. I can’t make my wife happy, she should have just married HUGO instead of a loser like me. I guess I was vocalizing my thoughts as I was looking at my reflection in the broken glass. Linda stops me by telling me how she would rather be with a cannibal that has a dream than a health inspector with none. At that moment she fanned the flames of hope in me. At that moment I knew my wife really loved me. She wanted an adventure in life, and found that with me and my silly dream.",
        "Turns out there was a group of tourists that called themselves “Adventurous Eaters”. The one thing they’ve never tried was human flesh. Despite the rumor they were in. Willing to pay $50 a burger! This opportunity wasn’t going to pass me by so I rolled with it and set the price. That bus full of Wackos saved our business.",

        "Hi, I'm Tina and this morning… was weird.  As always, I got dressed and wore my blue Shirt and skirt. It's getting a bit stinky, I wear it all the time. After I got dressed I went downstairs to eat Breakfast. I was confused because Louise was… READING!?",
        "I sat down looking at Louise reading, and Jean looked too. Louise was muttering all the words then said, “A few more pages, I don't think I can take it.” So anyways, I found out that Louise was participating in this thing that if all the students read 500 books total, they get a field trip to this weird water park. My dad doesn't like the idea because of the accidents that happened before. Like the finger in the pool, diarrhea in the pool, and this bad bacteria thing. I want to go because Jimmy Jr. might be there.",
        "Later at school while I was watching everyone giving their book reports. The janitor and the principal came in freaking out like the time I got scammed out of my favorite toy pony “Chariot”, you know I'm all things pony. So it turns out that we can't go to the waterpark because someone killed the principal's dolls. Why did he have dolls in the first place.. Wait, I have dolls, never mind.",
        "So everyone went to the principal's room and there the dolls were, yarn and cotton everywhere. Everyone looked shocked, even Louise! So ummm… the water park got canceled. Louise was thinking that we should go to Miley's house because she thought that she could help us. When we got into Miley's room it looked just like Louise's room! Jean and I were sent outside to play on the tramp named “Oliene”. Jean was talking about how worried he was for Louise, but we forgot about that quickly because we loved jumping on “Oliene”.",
        "After a few days of going to Millie's house to jump on “Oliene”, they found out that it was the Principal! To make this short, we got to go to the water park! Jimmy Jr. was sooooo cute.",
